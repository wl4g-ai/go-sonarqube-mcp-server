# SonarQube MCP Server - User Context

## What This MCP Server Provides

This MCP server gives you access to SonarQube's code quality and security analysis tools directly in your AI conversations. You can analyze code, check project quality, manage issues, and get detailed insights without leaving your chat.

## Setup

The user should provide the following environment variables:
- `SONARQUBE_TOKEN`: A SonarQube USER token
- `SONARQUBE_URL`: The URL of the SonarQube server (for SonarQube Server)
- `SONARQUBE_ORG`: The organization key (for SonarQube Cloud)

## How Users Typically Interact

### Finding Projects
**Example user requests:**
- "Show me my SonarQube projects"
- "List all projects in my organization"

**What to do:** Use `search_my_sonarqube_projects` to get the list. The results will show project keys that are needed for other operations.

### Analyzing Code Quality
**Example user requests:**
- "What's the quality gate status of my project?"
- "Check if my project passes quality gates"
- "How is the code quality for project X?"

**What to do:** Use `get_project_quality_gate_status` with the project key. If user doesn't know the project key, first use `search_my_sonarqube_projects`.

### Code Issues and Violations
**Example user requests:**
- "Show me the issues in my project"
- "Find security issues in project X"
- "List all bugs in my codebase"
- "Find all blocker issues in my codebase"

**What to do:** Use `search_sonar_issues_in_projects`. You can filter by project, software quality (MAINTAINABILITY, RELIABILITY, SECURITY), severity, issue status, branch, pull request, or search for a specific issue by key.

### Code Snippet Analysis
**Example user requests:**
- "Analyze this code snippet for issues"
- "Check this code for quality problems"  
- "Generate a method that does X and analyze it for issues"

**What to do:** Use `analyze_code_snippet` - always pass complete file content:
1. **Full analysis**: Pass `fileContent` only to get all issues
2. **Filtered analysis** (recommended for generated code): Pass `fileContent` + `codeSnippet` - tool analyzes full file but reports issues only in the snippet (auto-detects location)

**Supported Languages:**
- Java
- Kotlin
- Python (including IPython notebooks)
- Ruby
- Go
- JavaScript (`js`, `jsx`), TypeScript (`ts`, `tsx`), JSP
- PHP
- XML
- HTML, CSS
- Infrastructure as Code: CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Terraform, Azure Resource Manager, Ansible, Docker
- Secrets detection (works across all file types)

### Understanding Rules and Metrics
**Example user requests:**
- "What does this rule mean?" 
- "Explain rule javascript:S1234"
- "What metrics are available?"
- "Show me code complexity metrics"

**What to do:** Use `show_rule` for rule explanations, `search_metrics` for available metrics, and `get_component_measures` for specific metric values.

## Important Parameter Guidelines

### Project Keys

Always resolve the project key using the following lookup order — **never guess**:

1. **SonarQube for IDE (connected mode)**: If the MCP server is running with IDE integration (`SONARQUBE_IDE_PORT` is set), the project key may already be available from the IDE context.
2. **`.sonarlint/connectedMode.json`**: Look for this file in the workspace root (or any parent directory). It contains the project key in the `projectKey` field.
3. **Project-level configuration file**: Search for a `sonar.projectKey` property in files such as `sonar-project.properties`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`, or `package.json` in the root project folder.
4. **CI/CD pipeline definitions**: Search for `sonar.projectKey` in pipeline files such as `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, `.circleci/config.yml`, etc.
5. **User-provided project name**: When a user mentions a project by name or partial key, use `search_my_sonarqube_projects` to find the exact project key.
6. **No key found**: If none of the above methods yield a project key, use `search_my_sonarqube_projects` to list available projects.

### Code Language Detection
- When analyzing code snippets, try to detect the programming language from the code syntax
- Only the languages listed in the "Code Snippet Analysis" section are supported for local analysis
- If the code is in an unsupported language, inform the user about the limitation
- If unclear, ask the user or make an educated guess based on syntax
- Note: Secrets detection works on all file types regardless of language

### Branch and Pull Request Context
- **Long-lived branches** (main, develop, release/*): use the `branch` parameter. Discover valid names with `list_branches`.
- **Pull requests / feature branches**: use `pullRequest`. Discover PR keys with `list_pull_requests`.
- Never pass a git branch name to a `pullRequest` parameter — it expects the SonarQube PR key.
- Never provide both `branch` and `pullRequest` on the same call.
- Omit both to query the default (main) branch analysis.

### Code Issues and Violations
- After fixing issues, do not attempt to verify them using `search_sonar_issues_in_projects`, as the server will not yet reflect the updates

## Common Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- SonarQube requires USER tokens (not project tokens)
- When the error `SonarQube answered with Not authorized` occurs, verify the token type

### Project Not Found
- Use `search_my_sonarqube_projects` to confirm available projects
- Check if user has access to the specific project
- Verify project key spelling and format

### Code Analysis Issues
- Ensure programming language is correctly specified
- Remind users that snippet analysis doesn't replace full project scans
- Provide full file content for better analysis results
- Mention that code snippet analysis tool has limited capabilities compared to full SonarQube scans
